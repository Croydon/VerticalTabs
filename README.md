# ![](https://github.com/Croydon/vertical-tabs-reloaded/blob/master/data/icon.png) Vertical Tabs Reloaded for Firefox

This Firefox add-on arranges tabs in a vertical rather than horizontal
fashion. Vertical Tabs Reloaded is a fork of [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/), which was discontinued. The original project is heavily inspired by the Tree Style Tab add-on.

## Goals:

* Ability to arrange tabs in groups (instead of arbitrary trees) plus
  some group-related features (collapse group, tab previews, etc.)

* Minimalist implementation.

* Native look and feel and ability to customize if wanted.

* Readable and maintainable code.
